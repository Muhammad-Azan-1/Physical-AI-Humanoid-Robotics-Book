# Issue Report: Module 1 Content Review

## Review Summary
Module 1 covers "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" with content for Weeks 1-2 (Introduction to Physical AI) and Weeks 3-5 (ROS 2 Fundamentals). The content is well-structured with progressive disclosure using Tabs/TabItems for full content and summary views.

## Technical Accuracy Assessment
- Content accurately describes ROS 2 architecture and DDS
- Code examples for publisher nodes are technically correct
- URDF examples are valid XML format
- References to industry standards (DDS) are accurate
- Real-world examples (Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas, Unitree G1) are current

## Completeness Assessment
- Learning outcomes are clearly defined
- Content covers all major ROS 2 concepts (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, Launch files, URDF)
- Code examples are practical and well-explained
- Good balance of theory and practice

## Issues Identified

### High Severity
- **I004**: Missing prerequisites section for Module 1 - students need to know what background knowledge is required before starting

### Medium Severity
- **I005**: Limited hands-on exercises - more practical examples would enhance learning
- **I006**: Missing troubleshooting section for common ROS 2 setup issues

### Low Severity
- **I007**: Minor formatting inconsistency in code block spacing in week3-5.md
