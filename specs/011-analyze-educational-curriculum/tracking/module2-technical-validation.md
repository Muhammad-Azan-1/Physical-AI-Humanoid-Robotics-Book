# Technical Validation Report: Module 2

## Overview
Module 2 covers "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" with content for Weeks 6-7.

## Technical Accuracy Assessment

### Accurate Content
- Gazebo Harmonic vs Classic explanation is technically correct
- URDF vs SDF format explanations are accurate
- Code examples for URDF and SDF are technically correct
- Information about physics engines (ODE, Bullet, Dart) is accurate
- Sensor simulation explanations (LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU) are correct
- Unity Robotics Hub information is current

### Areas Requiring SME Validation
- Gazebo Classic EOL date (mentioned as 2025, needs verification)
- Specific version compatibility claims
- Hardware requirements for simulation

### Identified Issues
- I003: Outdated Gazebo Classic EOL information in week6-7.md - needs verification and update
- I004: Minor formatting in code block descriptions

## Validation Status
Overall technical accuracy: HIGH
Content requiring SME validation: MEDIUM (for EOL dates and version-specific claims)
