# Issue Report: Module 2 Content Review

## Review Summary
Module 2 covers "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" with content for Weeks 6-7. The content explains simulation concepts, Gazebo Harmonic vs Classic, URDF vs SDF, and Unity integration for visualization.

## Technical Accuracy Assessment
- Content correctly describes Gazebo Harmonic as the new modular architecture
- Information about URDF and SDF formats is accurate
- Code examples for URDF and SDF are technically correct
- Explanation of sensors (LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU) is accurate
- Unity Robotics Hub information is current

## Completeness Assessment
- Learning outcomes are clearly defined
- Content covers all major simulation concepts
- Good explanation of Digital Twin paradigm
- Adequate code examples and explanations

## Issues Identified

### High Severity
- **I008**: Outdated information - Gazebo Classic EOL date may be incorrect (stated as 2025, but actual EOL may vary)

### Medium Severity
- **I009**: Missing hands-on exercises for practical implementation
- **I010**: Limited troubleshooting section for simulation setup issues

### Low Severity
- **I011**: Minor formatting in code block descriptions
