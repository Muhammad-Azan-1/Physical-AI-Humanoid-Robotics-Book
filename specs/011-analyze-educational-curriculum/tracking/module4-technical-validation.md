# Technical Validation Report: Module 4

## Overview
Module 4 covers "Vision-Language-Action (VLA)" with content for Weeks 11-13.

## Technical Accuracy Assessment

### Accurate Content
- Inverted pendulum problem explanation is technically correct
- ZMP vs RL approaches explanation is accurate
- Kinematics (FK vs IK) explanation is correct
- Whisper and GPT integration examples are technically sound
- ROS 2 action client code example is accurate
- VLA pipeline architecture is accurately described
- Unitree G1 case study information is current
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) explanation is correct

### Areas Requiring SME Validation
