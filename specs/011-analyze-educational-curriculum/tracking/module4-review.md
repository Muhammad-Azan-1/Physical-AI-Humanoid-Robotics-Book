# Issue Report: Module 4 Content Review

## Review Summary
Module 4 covers "Vision-Language-Action (VLA)" with content for Weeks 11-13. The content explains humanoid robot development, the inverted pendulum problem, kinematics, and the cognitive brain with VLA pipeline using Whisper and LLMs.

## Technical Accuracy Assessment
- Content accurately describes the inverted pendulum problem and ZMP vs RL approaches
- Information about Unitree G1 is current
- Kinematics explanations (FK vs IK) are correct
- Code examples for Whisper node and action client are technically sound
- VLA pipeline architecture is accurately described

## Completeness Assessment
- Learning outcomes are clearly defined
- Content covers all major VLA concepts
- Good explanation of the cognitive pipeline
- Adequate code examples and explanations
- Capstone integration clearly outlined

## Issues Identified

### High Severity
- **I016**: Missing prerequisites section for Module 4 - students need to know about hardware requirements and dependencies

### Medium Severity
- **I017**: Limited hands-on exercises for practical implementation of the VLA pipeline
- **I018**: Missing troubleshooting section for VLA integration issues

### Low Severity
- **I019**: Minor formatting in code block descriptions
