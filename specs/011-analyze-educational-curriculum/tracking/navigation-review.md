# Navigation Structure Review

## Current Navigation Structure
The sidebar navigation is well-organized with a clear hierarchical structure:

- Introduction page
- Module 1: Foundations
  - Overview
  - Weeks 1-2
  - Weeks 3-5
- Module 2: ROS 2 for Humanoids
  - Overview
  - Weeks 6-7
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain
  - Overview
  - Weeks 8-10
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
  - Overview
  - Weeks 11-13

## Assessment
- Navigation is logically structured by modules
- Each module has an overview page followed by weekly content
- Generated index pages provide module landing pages
- Clear progression from basic to advanced concepts

## Issues Identified
- **I020**: Navigation could benefit from clearer week labeling to show the 13-week progression more explicitly
- **I021**: Missing search functionality integration assessment (though this may be handled by Docusaurus default)

## Recommendations
- Consider adding week numbers more prominently in the navigation labels
- Ensure all generated index pages have comprehensive content
