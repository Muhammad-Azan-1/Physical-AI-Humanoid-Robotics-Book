# Research: Analyze and Improve Educational Curriculum

## Decision: Curriculum Analysis Approach
**Rationale**: The approach focuses on systematic analysis of educational content to identify gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement. This ensures the Physical AI curriculum meets high standards for student learning.

## Analysis of Current Curriculum Structure

### Modules Overview
- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Weeks 1-5
- **Module 2**: ROS 2 for Humanoids - Weeks 6-7
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain - Weeks 8-10
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Weeks 11-13

### Content Quality Assessment
- Current content covers foundational concepts in Physical AI
- Technical accuracy appears consistent with industry standards
- Progression from basic to advanced topics is logical
- Missing elements identified: assessment methods, detailed learning objectives

### User Experience Elements
- Navigation structure exists via sidebar
- Content formatted with progressive disclosure (full content and summary tabs)
- Consistent formatting across modules
- Areas for improvement: clearer learning pathways, better assessment integration

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Complete Curriculum Rewrite
- **Rejected**: Too disruptive and resource-intensive
- **Reason**: Current curriculum has solid foundation; improvements should be incremental

### Alternative 2: Add New Modules Only
- **Rejected**: Doesn't address existing content quality issues
- **Reason**: Need to ensure existing content meets standards before adding new content

### Alternative 3: Systematic Analysis and Improvement (Selected)
- **Chosen**: Addresses both content quality and user experience
- **Reason**: Comprehensive approach that maintains existing structure while improving quality
