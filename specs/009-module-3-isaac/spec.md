# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## 1. Overview
This module focuses on **Advanced Perception and Training** using the NVIDIA Isaac platform. It bridges the gap between basic simulation (Gazebo) and photorealistic, AI-driven simulation (Isaac Sim). Students will learn to use Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation and Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception.

### User Scenarios
- **Student** wants to understand why Isaac Sim is needed over Gazebo.
- **Student** needs to learn how to generate synthetic data for training computer vision models.
- **Student** wants to implement VSLAM and navigation using Isaac ROS.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Content:**
    - Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim.
    - Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation.
    - Isaac ROS: VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and Navigation (Nav2).
    - Reinforcement Learning for robot control.
    - Sim-to-Real transfer techniques.
- **Structure:**
    - `physical-ai-book/docs/module3/index.md`: Overview page with Tabs (Full/Summary).
    - `physical-ai-book/docs/module3/week8-10.md`: Detailed content for Weeks 8-10 with Tabs.
- **Navigation:**
    - Update `sidebars.ts` to include Module 3.
    - Update `CurriculumPreviewSection.tsx` to link to Module 3.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Consistency:** Follow the same "Overview + Weekly Content" structure as Modules 1 and 2.
- **Tone:** Technical, educational, and "Humanoid-First".
- **Visuals:** Use Tabs for depth and summary.

## 3. Success Criteria
- Module 3 is accessible via the sidebar and homepage.
- Content accurately reflects the "Weeks 8-10" curriculum.
- No broken links.
