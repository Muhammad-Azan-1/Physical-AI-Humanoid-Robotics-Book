# Feature Specification: Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Feature Branch**: `008-module-2-digital-twin`
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Course Details from `HackthoneTextBook.md`

## Overview

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) focuses on physics simulation and environment building. It covers simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo, high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity, and simulating sensors like LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Read Module 2 Introduction (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to read the introduction to Module 2 so that I understand the importance of simulation and the "Digital Twin" concept in robotics.

**Why this priority**: Contextualizes the simulation tools (Gazebo/Unity) within the broader Physical AI curriculum.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the Module 2 page and verify the introduction text matches the course details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am on the Module 2 page, **When** I read the content, **Then** I see the focus on "Physics simulation and environment building" and key topics like Gazebo, Unity, and Sensor Simulation.

### User Story 2 - Access Week 6-7 Content (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to access the content for Weeks 6-7 (Robot Simulation with Gazebo) so that I can learn how to set up simulations and define robots.

**Why this priority**: Core technical skill for the module.

**Independent Test**: Verify links/sections for Weeks 6-7 content are present and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am on the Module 2 page, **When** I look for Week 6-7 content, **Then** I find sections/pages covering "Gazebo simulation environment setup", "URDF and SDF robot description formats", "Physics simulation and sensor simulation", and "Introduction to Unity for robot visualization".

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a dedicated page for Module 2.

    - Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo.
    - High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity.
    - Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.
- **FR-003**: The content MUST cover the "Weeks 6-7: Robot Simulation with Gazebo" breakdown:
    - Gazebo simulation environment setup.
    - URDF and SDF robot description formats.
    - Physics simulation and sensor simulation.
    - Introduction to Unity for robot visualization.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Module 2 page is accessible from the main navigation or homepage.
- **SC-002**: Content accurately reflects the provided course details for Module 2 and Weeks 6-7.
