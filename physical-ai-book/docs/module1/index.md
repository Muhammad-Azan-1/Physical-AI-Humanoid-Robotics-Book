# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="full" label="Full Content" default>

**Focus:** Middleware for robot control.

This module establishes the foundational "nervous system" of our humanoid robots using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System). Just as a biological nervous system transmits signals between the brain and the body, ROS 2 manages the communication between our AI agents (the brain) and the robot's actuators and sensors (the body).

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1.  Understand the core architecture of ROS 2.
2.  Create and manage ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.
3.  Bridge Python AI agents to ROS controllers using `rclpy`.
4.  Describe humanoid robot structures using URDF.

## Weekly Breakdown

*   **Weeks 1-2:** Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence.
*   **Weeks 3-5:** ROS 2 Fundamentals & Architecture.
