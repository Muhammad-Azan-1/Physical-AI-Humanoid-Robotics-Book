# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="full" label="Full Content" default>

**Focus:** Physics simulation and environment building.

This module introduces the concept of the **Digital Twin**—a virtual replica of our physical robot and its environment. Before we trust our AI algorithms with expensive hardware and human safety, we must validate them in high-fidelity simulations. We will use Gazebo for physics-accurate simulation and Unity for photorealistic rendering.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1.  **Simulate Robots:** Use Gazebo to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions.
2.  **Describe Robots:** Master URDF and SDF formats to define robot structure and environments.
3.  **Simulate Sensors:** Implement virtual LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.
4.  **Visualize:** Use Unity for high-fidelity visualization and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

## Weekly Breakdown

*   **Weeks 6-7:** Robot Simulation with Gazebo & Unity.
