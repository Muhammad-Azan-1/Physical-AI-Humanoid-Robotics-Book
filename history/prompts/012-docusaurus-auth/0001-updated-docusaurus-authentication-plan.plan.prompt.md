## Prompt

Updated Docusaurus Authentication Plan plan --feature "012-docusaurus-auth"

## Response snapshot

Analyzed and updated the implementation plan for the Docusaurus authentication system, enhancing it with detailed architecture decisions, security considerations, testing strategy, and deployment configuration.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Enhanced the authentication system implementation plan with comprehensive architecture decisions, security measures, testing strategy, and detailed component structure for the Docusaurus-based educational platform
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated plan.md with detailed implementation architecture and created PHR record
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate actionable tasks from the plan, /sp.adr to document significant architectural decisions
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan now includes specific implementation phases, security considerations, and testing strategy that weren't in the initial version

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Review the updated plan with stakeholders to validate the architecture decisions
