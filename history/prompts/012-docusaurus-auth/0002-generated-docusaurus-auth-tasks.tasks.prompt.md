## Prompt

Generated Docusaurus Auth Tasks tasks --feature "012-docusaurus-auth"

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Docusaurus authentication system, organized by user story priority with specific file paths and dependencies.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed tasks.md file with 80+ specific implementation tasks organized by user story priority for the Docusaurus authentication system
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with structured implementation tasks from spec and plan
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute the tasks, /sp.adr to document architectural decisions
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent testing and validation of each feature

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks to establish authentication foundation
